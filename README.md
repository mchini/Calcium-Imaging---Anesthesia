# Anesthetics uniquely decorrelate hippocampal networkactivity, alter spine dynamics and affect memory consolidation

This repository contains code that was used to analyze calcium imaging data for the calcium imaging data of the paper "Anesthetics uniquely decorrelate hippocampal networkactivity, alter spine dynamics and affect memory consolidation".
Moreover, scripts and the datasets that were used for all statistical analysis are in the folder "Stats".
Code for the ephys part of the paper can be found in this other repository: https://github.com/mchini/HanganuOpatzToolbox
This is still preliminary, but will be finalized before the paper will be published.
